3D printing is the process in which a 3D printer is used to create a three-dimensional object. 
In the early 1980s, the first 3D printer was invented by Charles W. Hull, in which he used the technique called Stereolithography.  

3D printing starts from creating a three-dimensional computer graphic of the object in a computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) program, a 3D scanner, or from a photogrammetry software. The 3D computer graphics is then converted and processed into the software that is appropriate for the 3D printer being used. The printer then builds the three-dimensional object layer-by-layer. 

3D printing uses a variety of materials - 3D printing materials such as Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Polylactic Acid (PLA), Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA), Nylon, High-density polyethylene (HDPE), Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), PETG (combined with glycol), wood filaments, sandstone, ceramic, metal filaments, carbon fiber mix, Cobalt-Chromium, Inconel, paper, Stereolithography (SLA) resins, wax, and many other materials. 
But the most widely used by consumers are materials made from thermoplastics. 

3D printed objects are considered to be made from scratch and utilize the additive process. Unlike manufactured objects that are made from traditional, costly, and time-consuming techniques such as, the subtractive (CNC machining) and formative (Injection molding) processes.
